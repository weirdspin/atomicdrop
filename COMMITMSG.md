Implement Phase 4: Integration & Animation.

- Implement `handleBet` function in App.jsx to connect game logic with the UI.
- Implement ball animation in PlinkoBoard.jsx using dynamic CSS keyframes based on the game outcome path.
- Pass necessary props (`path`, `multipliers`, `handleBet`) from App to child components.
